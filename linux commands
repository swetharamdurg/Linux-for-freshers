1. Grep(global regular expression print):It is used to search for a pattern.
Syntax: grep pattern filename/filename along with path
Ex: grep permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Reading entire file to search a specific word will be time consuming, at that time you can use grep command. It will display all the lines which has that word in the file
For the above example,It will display all the lines which has permit in sshd_config file.
Also need to remember that it is case sensitive. If you mention permit instead of Permit that it will not display.
If you are not sure whether its capital letter or small letter, then you can use the flag or option -i to ignore case sensitive.
Grep will work only on files.

grep -i pattern filename

grep -i permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.Pipe "|" command:
Pipe symbol is represented with a vertical line ie "|".
It is a kind of redirection, where it takes the output of one command and gives it as input to another command.
syntax:command | command pattern
ex:ls -ltr | grep simple (here file name is not required at the end as output of la -ltr is considered as input for grep command ie it will search for simple word in the output of ls -ltr).
It will display all the lines which has simple in the output of ls -ltr.
one more example:if you want to search all the directories in the output of ls -ltr ie basically the first letter will be d if its a directory then u can use
ls -ltr | grep ^d

=>cat peanut.txt | grep -i s
we can use it in the above way as well but it doesnt make sense as directly we can use grep -i s peanut.txt



3. file command:
If you want to find the type of file then use the command file.
 syntax:file filename
 
4.change directory(cd):
a.If you want to go to your home directory then use tilde symbol ie cd ~
b.If you want to navigate to a specific directory from anywhere from the file system then you can either use relative path or absolute path.
cd relative path( path that doesnt start from /)
cd absolute path(path that starts from root ie /)
cd directoryname(if that directory is present in current directory)
c. If you want to go to your parent directory from current directory then use cd ..

5.pwd(print working directory):
It will show the present working directory

6.sed command(stream editor):It is used to search for a word in the file and replace with the required in the output.
Note: It will only make changes in the output but it will not make any changes to the original file.But with option i you can change in the file too

If you want to just change in the out put then use
sed 's/existingWord/wordToBeReplaced' filename  
example:sed 's/ansible/pink' peanut.txt , this will search for ansible in peanut.txt and replace it with pink in the output only , not in the original file. And only it will replace ansible
not ansible.cfg or Ansible.cfg ie its case sensitive

If you want even to consider extn along with word ie if that is part of the word ,then also if you want to consider then use flag g ie global
example:sed 's/ansible/pink/g' peanut.txt
s stands for search
Here it will replace ansible.cfg not Ansible

If you want to ignore case sensitive then use i option
sed 's/ansible/pink/ig' peanut.txt

If you want to make chnages to original file then use i flag ie
sed -i 's/ansible/pink/ig' peanut.txt
