1. Grep(global regular expression print):It is used to search for a pattern.
Syntax: grep pattern filename/filename along with path
Ex: grep permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Reading entire file to search a specific word will be time consuming, at that time you can use grep command. It will display all the lines which has that word in the file
For the above example,It will display all the lines which has permit in sshd_config file.
Also need to remember that it is case sensitive. If you mention permit instead of Permit that it will not display.
If you are not sure whether its capital letter or small letter, then you can use the flag or option -i to ignore case sensitive

grep -i pattern filename

grep -i permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
