Before trying to understand all the details ,we need to know about file permissions.
Permissions are applied at 3 levels:Owner/user level, group level and others level
Permissions are applied in 3 ways:read,write and execute. 
r-Read means read only
w-Write means write,edit,append and delete
x-execute means to run/execute a prog

8 attributes, 
10 bits , 1st one file type, 2to4 rwx related to owner of the file, 5to7 rwx related to group to which file belongs to and 8to10 rwx related to other users.
cd /tmp -if u create files in tmp all users can access it

 ls -ltr o/p: second column is the number of hard links to the file. For a directory, 
the number of hard links is the number of immediate subdirectories it has plus its parent directory and itself.

3rd columns- displays the file owner name
4th column -displays the group name to which the file belong
5th column- size of the file in bytes
6th column-date 
7th column -time
8th column -filename/directoryname



FILE PERMISSIONS: File permissions can be set on file/directory in two methods
1.Symbolic method(ugo)
2.Absolute method(numbers)

syntax for the symbolic method:
chmod [who] [+/-/=] [permissions] filename
who=user/owner(u),group(g),others(o)
permissions=read(r),write(w) and execute(x)
ex: chmod u=wrx,g=rw,o=r file1
chmod g-x,o-wx filename



syntax for absolute method:

read=4
write=2
execute=1

chmod 734 file1
which means for file1, the owner has read,write and execute permissions,group members has 2+1=3 ie write and execute permissions, others have only read permission
