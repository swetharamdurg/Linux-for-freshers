There are mainly 3 types of users in linux.
1.Root user or super user:This user is the most powerful user. It has all previledges. 
2. Normal users: Users created by root user.
3.System user: user created by software or applications ex: tomcat

Home directory of root user ie /root
go there and type: whoami 

if you want to know more about the user then give: id username ie id root

All the users information is stored in /etc/passwd

cat /etc/passwd
there will be x beside username which means password

you cant see by default home directory created in ec2 instance for that u need to follow different steps to create user:we will see it later.


refer -https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-ec2-user-guide/edit/master/doc_source/managing-users.md

when ever a user is created ,default with the same name a group is also created, u can see it in /etc/group
cat /etc/group

now if i want to add user ex: user peter to swethi group then, swethi will have two groups after this as we are using G ie secondary group
usermod -G groupname username
usermod -G swethi peter
now peter will have both swethi and peter as groups but if u want primary group to be changed then use -g option, then it will have only one group id
usermod -g swethi peter


login as user on ec2:
Now we have already created swethi, peter. I want to login as swethi
->passwd swethi
enter the new password which u want to set for swethi
,re enter .
root@ip-172-31-25-53:/home# passwd swethi
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully


But in aws ec2 instance we need to do additional configuration to , now connect to ssh with this user to login
It didnt allow -no supported authentication methods available
we need to provide private key for swethi but we do not have private key for swethi
so we need to make some changes in our system so that new user can use password to login instead of key.
For that we will configure a configuration file ie 
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Go to PasswordAuthentication , make it yes from no(if its no means its not allowing password login but we want password login so we are changing it to yes).Control o 
and then enter later control x.
You changes will be saved.
Usually when we update configuration files we need to restart our services.
service sshd reload
open putty or mobaxterm
use the ip , without key and username ,open it
it will ask for username-give swethi
password-swethi
whoami
you shd be able to see swethi as the output which means swethi is the user who is logged in.
